## Config Nvim with Lua

How to config Nvim through Lua: `:help lua-guide`

The Lua API contains 3 parts:
- The inherited Vim API through `vim.cmd()` and `vim.fn` for ex-commands, builtin-functions, and user-functions in Vimscript.
- The Nvim API through `vim.api`.
- The Lua API through anything else in `vim.*` not already mentioned.
